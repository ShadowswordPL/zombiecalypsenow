# Zombiecalypse Now #

Zombiecalypse Now is android game, which use phone camera to display zombies crawling around you.
You can fight fight them by turning around and hitting them with your crowbar.

The game has three levels. The prototype is rather playable and very enjoyable, anyway underlying
LOOK! (http://www.lookar.net/) library seems to have problem with correct calibration with most
android devices, so the further development and release were abandoned after prototype phase.
